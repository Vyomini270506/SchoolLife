                This is the last stage of school life. You lose many friends as well as make new ones. First two year were online. Enjoyed a lot and then struggled for two years. Suddenly you are expected to study for 3x the amount of time you used to in middle school. From 'ok ji' to 'sirf JEE'. From friends to rivals. Yes, everything changes suddenly :(

                K-pop and k-drama became very popular. I myself was a 'BLINK' and 'ARMY'. Tik-Tok got banned. The first batch to give 2 boards in 10th and that too one of them was fully mcqs based :|....We saw changes in JEE/NEET syllabus :o.Somewhere during these years we all grew up. We said goodbye to our inner child and welcome a young adult :) Click on college to know more about this new adult life ;)
