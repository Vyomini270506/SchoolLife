                I spent this part of my life with full joy. I remember each and everything. In my opinion this is the stage where you explore academic , extra-curricular and sports area equally and freely. You study , you take part in various activities and play sports with full enthuiasm without caring about future :) :)

            <p>Tik-Tok was quite popular during these years ;p ...everbody turned into a dancer/singer/actor or 'TIK-TOKER'. Western Songs(esp. Spanish) became very popular in schools. But after this stage something happened that changed Human History.....click on High School to know more bout it :o</p>
