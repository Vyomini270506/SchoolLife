                    After doing well in JEE Mains, I got seat in SVNIT :) :) First semester was really wierd. I have mix feelings for that semester. At one moment I was overly happy and the very next I was confused/sad.You are free to explore your own ways of study. Some prefer books, some youtube and some ChatGPT ;p.....well I use all three of them. You meet people from different parts of country and get to know about interesting facts about their culture and esp. food items :) ;p.

                    Finally, I opened my Instagram account and yep it's quite addictive :| My WhatsApp is full with groups about which sometimes I don't have any idea!! Going outside the campus with friends is something which I love the most :)
